<h2>
    Hi! Welcome "At Home" Website, we are Avery and Haylie!
    <br>
    We came up a idea, it stared how we thought Amazon has all these things but not as specific and we always have trouble having time to go the store and get stuff for our house. Then At Home was created! We both are from Arizona and have a degree of construction and took software development class. So we had all Materials of making our best website yet! we hope that you enjoy of our website and that it is helpful!
